Analyze a dataset to predict employee attrition

### **Predicting Employee Attrition**

#### **Objective:**
Analyze a dataset to predict employee attrition, providing insights for the HR department to improve retention strategies.

#### **Deliverables:**
1. **One-Page Summary**: A concise overview of the project, your methodology, findings, and impact on HR.
2. **Code Notebook**: A detailed notebook that includes:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data.
   - **Model Building**: Use either a **regression model** (e.g., Logistic Regression) or **machine learning model** (e.g., Random Forest) to predict attrition.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
   - **Visualization**: Create charts like feature importance or a correlation heatmap.
   - **Ethical Considerations**: Discuss potential biases and fairness.
   - **Resources**: List any resources used during the project.

#### **Approach:**
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and feature engineering.
- **Model Selection**: Choose a regression or machine learning model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance and interpret results.
- **Visualization**: Show key insights (e.g., important features, relationships).
- **Ethics**: Address fairness in predictions.

#### **Example Summary:**
- **Objective**: Build a model to predict employee attrition for HR insights.
- **Method**: Used **Random Forest** to predict attrition with key features like employee satisfaction, tenure, and salary.
- **Evaluation**: Achieved an **F1 score of 0.85**, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.
- **Ethics**: Ensured fairness and avoided bias in the model.
- **Outcome**: Provided actionable insights to help HR improve retention strategies.

This project will result in both a **high-level summary** for non-technical stakeholders and a **detailed code notebook** showcasing your technical skills.
